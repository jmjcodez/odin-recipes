# odin-recipes
This project is part of TOP (The Odin Project) curriculum. I will be appliying my lessons in basic HTML to create a simple webpage.

The page will feature links to some cooking recipes - with basic HTML elements. CSS formatting will be added later.

Upon completion I will demonstrate how to create a basic webpage.
